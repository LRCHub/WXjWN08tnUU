I've been lookin' too hard for a home on the top
On the top of the surface searchin'
Lookin' for something deep
Thought, "It's too hard to reach"
Never thought I was someone deservin'
But it was all in my head, heavy weight on my chest
Only ever left me hurtin'
Now I'm callin' a truce on the war in my mind 'cause I'm finally learnin' I'm not
Rollin' over, under, inside out
Turnin' myself all the way around
What you see is what you get, so
Baby, you can take me as I am
(Take it or leave it, you can take it and leave it)
(You can take it or leave it, you can)
Cause' I know I'ma take me as I am
(Take it or leave it, you can take it or leave it)
(You can take it or leave it, you can take it or leave it)
Got me under safekeepin' for those
Who can grow to love all my pieces
I'm not going to settle to be tolerated
Or put on a shelf for decoration
And I know that means my circle gets smaller
But it don't mean I have less left to offer
And those I ride with will just stick around offer 'cause I'm no longer
Rollin' over, under, inside out
Turnin' myself all the way around
What you see is what you get, so
Baby, you can take me as I am
(Take it or leave it, you can take it and leave it)
(You can take it or leave it, you can)
Cause' I know I'ma take me as I am
(Take it or leave it, you can take it or leave it)
(You can take it or leave it, you can take it or leave it)
Take it or leave it, you can take it or leave it
You can take it or leave it, you can take it or leave it
Take it or leave it, you can take it or leave it
You can take it or leave it, you can take it or leave it
Take it or leave it, you can take it or leave it
You can take it or leave it, you can take it or leave it
Take it or leave it, you can take it or leave it
You can take it or leave it, you can take it or leave it
