Straight out of a Rolling Stone Magazine
A blue jean baby
My American dream
You're a Hollywood smile
Flying so high out of my league
Well, I'm a little reckless
Yeah, but you're the one for me

So take me as I am
Whoa, everybody knows
This life yeah is a crazy road
Well, hallelujah bless your soul
Take me as I am
Whoa, and don't let go

Now you were built for speed
Better take it slow
Well, you're sunshine
And I'm neon glow
Well darling we weren't meant
To walk this world alone
And right here in my arms is where you belong

So take me as I am
Whoa, everybody knows
This life yeah is a crazy road
Well, hallelujah bless your soul
Take me as I am
Whoa, and don't let go

That's right (ooh-ooh, ooh)
Don't let go, no (ooh-ooh, ooh)
Oh, baby, baby, baby (ooh-ooh, ooh)

Take me (would you take me?) as I am (as I am)
Take me (please, babe) as I am (as I am)
(Please) take me (please take me) as I am
Take me as I am

So take me as I am
Whoa, everybody knows
This life yeah is a crazy road
Well, hallelujah bless your soul
Take me as I am
Whoa, and don't let go

Take me as I am
Take me as I am
