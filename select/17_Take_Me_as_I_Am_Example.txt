I know I mess around, cos' I've ruined before
I always seem to spoil myself, of that you can be sure
And if you want this journey, reach out and take my hand
I'm so so far from perfect
Will you take me as I am
As I am

Bite me, fight me, then ignore me
Don't look back, you know the story
Forgive me, hold me, say you'll see me
Hate me again, but never leave me
If you want this journey, reach out and take my hand
I'm so so far from perfect
Will you take me as I am
As I am

Take me as I am

Take me, take me, take me, don't leave me
Take me, take me, take me, don't leave me
Take me, take me, take me, don't leave me
Take me as I am

Bite me, fight me, then ignore me
Don't look back, you know the story
Forgive me, hold me, say you'll see me
Hate me again, but never leave me
If you want this journey, reach out and take my hand
I'm so so far from perfect
Will you take me as I am
As I am

It's happened again, back in the same place
It's happened again, you and that same face
Same place, same place, same place

Take me as I am

Take me, take me, take me, don't leave me
Take me, take me, take me, don't leave me
Take me, take me, take me, don't leave me
Take me as I am

If you want this journey, reach out and take my hand
I'm so so far from perfect
Will you take me as I am
As I am
