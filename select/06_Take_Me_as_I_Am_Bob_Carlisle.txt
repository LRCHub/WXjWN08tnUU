Time after time
As I look over my life
How I've survived, I don't know
I've leaned out over the edge
Into the darkness, and yet
You've kept me from falling below
God, You know I wear no badge of honor
Despite the way I hoped that I would be

Take me as I am
Take me as a man
Who's waiting
Yours for the molding and making
Take me as I am
Just an ordinary man
Whose heart is aching
With all that I am

Holy and pure
You are the healing and cure
For all of my self-rooted wounds
I've not a thing to conceal
I stand here naked and revealed
My sole source of cover is in You
Search me with the white hot light of heaven
And when you see the darkness of my soul

Take me as I am
Take me as a man
Who's waiting
Yours for the molding and making
Take me as I am
Just an ordinary man
Whose heart is aching
With all that I am

So if there ever was a man in need of mercy
And the shelter of Your love, dear God, it's me

Take me as I am
Take me as a man
Who's waiting
Yours for the molding and making
Take me as I am
Just an ordinary man
Who's waiting
Yours for the molding and making...
