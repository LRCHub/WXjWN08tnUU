I been looking too hard
for a home on the top,
on the top of the surface,
searchin'
Looking for something deep,
thought it's too hard to reach,
never thought I
was someone deservin'
But it was all in my head,
heavy weight on my chest only
ever left me hurtin'
Now I'm callin' a truce
on the war in my mind
'cause I'm finally learnin'
I'm not
Rollin' over, under, inside out
Turnin' myself
all the way around
What you see is what you get
So baby, you can
Take me as I am
Take it or leave it,
you can take it or leave it
You can take it or leave it,
you can
'Cause I know
I'ma take me as I am
Take it or leave it,
you can take it or leave it
You can take it or leave it,
you can take it or leave it
Got me under safekeepin'
for those who can grow to love
all of my pieces
I'm not gonna settle to be
tolerated or put on a shelf
for decoration
And I know that it means
that my circle gets smaller,
but it don't mean I have
less left to offer
And those that are right will
just stick around longer
'Cause I'm no longer
Rollin' over, under, inside out
Turnin' myself
all the way around
What you see is what you get
So baby, you can
Take me as I am
Take it or leave it,
you can take it or leave it
You can take it or leave it,
you can
'Cause I know
I'ma take me as I am
Take it or leave it,
you can take it or leave it
You can take it or leave it,
you can take it or leave it
Take it or leave it,
you can take it or leave it
You can take it or leave it,
you can take it or leave it
Take it or leave it,
you can take it or leave it
You can take it or leave it,
you can take it or leave it
Take it or leave it,
you can take it or leave it
You can take it or leave it,
you can take it or leave it
Take it or leave it,
you can take it or leave it
You can take it or leave it,
you can take it or leave it
